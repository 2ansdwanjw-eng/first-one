ICON FILES REQUIRED

The extension requires three icon files that are referenced in manifest.json:

1. icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
2. icon48.png (48x48 pixels) 
3. icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

Since these are binary image files, you'll need to create them yourself:

OPTION 1: Create Simple Icons
- Use any image editor (GIMP, Photoshop, Paint.NET, etc.)
- Create a simple icon with the text "R$" or a Roblox-themed design
- Save as PNG files with the exact names and sizes specified above

OPTION 2: Use Online Icon Generators
- Visit sites like favicon.io, realfavicongenerator.net, or similar
- Upload a base image or create a simple design
- Generate the required sizes

OPTION 3: Download Sample Icons
- Search for "Roblox icon" or "gaming icon" on icon sites
- Download and resize to the required dimensions
- Rename to match the manifest.json references

OPTION 4: Use Text-Based Icons
- Create simple text-based icons using CSS or SVG
- Convert to PNG format at the required sizes

IMPORTANT: The icon files must exist and be named exactly as specified in manifest.json, or the extension will fail to load properly.

Place all icon files in the same directory as your other extension files.
